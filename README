I'd like to present a standalone command line vanity address miner built for opencl (gpu's).

Usage :

oclminer -p [PLATFORM_ID] -d [DEVICE_ID] -u https://satoshi.xcrack.net/ -a [YOURBITCOINADDRESS]

Whats XCrack ?

XCrack is a network/website/pool for cracking satoshi nakamotos fortune at the start of the blockchain.
There is over 500 million up for grabs, so why not join and get paid when we find a address worth 50 bitcoins :)
